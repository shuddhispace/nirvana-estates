        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Nirvana Estates isn’t just another real estate consultancy—it’s the evolution of a legacy that began in 2007, when Savitaben Parmar laid the foundation with a mission to help people find homes they truly belong in.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">What started as a humble, trust-based venture has grown into a modern, full-spectrum real estate advisory rooted in values, transparency, and deep local insight—led today by her son, Nikunj Parmar.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">While most realtors begin with sales, Nikunj began with structure. A Civil Engineer by education and a Canada-trained Project Manager, he has been immersed in real estate since 2014. His journey spans layout plans, building approvals, buyer psychology, market cycles, and international work with custom home builders and consultants.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">His vision is simple yet powerful: <em>“To bring structure, integrity, and professionalism to MaKaBo’s unorganised real estate market.”</em></p>
